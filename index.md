## About me

I am a Compiler Enginner at AMD, currently working on the Fortran team for HPC
workloads. I have worked on static data race detection for OpenMP programs(LLVM)
and on static analysis of C/C++ code for coding standards. I have also worked on
MLIR. I am also interested in Programming Languages and Operating Systems. I am
a [CSE IITH](https://cse.iith.ac.in/) Alumnus and I play Table Tennis.

## Publications

 1. Sparsh Mittal, and Shraiysh Vaishay. "A survey of techniques for optimizing deep learning on GPUs." Journal of Systems Architecture 99 (2019): 101635.

## Projects

 1. [Hoare-Logic Verifier](https://github.com/shraiysh/hoare-logic)
    : Contract verification - interpreter for language and array logic for classroom demonstration of the application of Hoare logic on a simple programming language and verify its correctness (using lex/yacc)
 2. [Code-Compliance](https://github.com/sbjoshi/code-compliance)
    : Worked on a static analysis of C/C++ programs (Code Compliance) using Clang/LLVM. Verified a subset of rules from certification standards like CERT, MISRA etc.
 3. [COOL - Classroom Object Oriented Language](https://github.com/shraiysh/CoolSemanticAnalyzer)
    : Worked on semantic analyzer and LLVM IR code generator for COOL as a part of classroom project (The code generator is a private repository)
