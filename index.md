## About me

I am a Compiler Enginner at AMD, currently working on the Fortran team for HPC workloads. I am working on static data race detection for OpenMP programs(LLVM) and on static analysis of C/C++ code for coding standards. I have also worked on MLIR. I am also interested in Programming Languages and Operating Systems. I am a [CSE IITH](https://cse.iith.ac.in/) Alumnus and I play Table Tennis.

## Projects and Open Source Contributions

 1. [Hoare-Logic Verifier](https://github.com/shraiysh/hoare-logic)
    : Contract verification - interpreter for language and array logic for classroom demonstration of the application of Hoare logic on a simple programming language and verify its correctness (using lex/yacc).
 2. [Code-Compliance](https://github.com/sbjoshi/code-compliance)
    : Worked on a static analysis of C/C++ programs (Code Compliance) using Clang/LLVM. Verified a subset of rules from certification standards like CERT, MISRA etc.
 3. [COOL - Classroom Object Oriented Language](https://github.com/shraiysh/CoolSemanticAnalyzer)
    : Worked on writing Lexer, Parser, Semantic Analyzer and LLVM IR code generator for COOL as a part of classroom project (The code generator is a private repository).
 4. [LLVM/MLIR Contributions](https://reviews.llvm.org/people/revisions/19492/)
    : Worked on translation of LLVM Dialect in MLIR to LLVM IR facilitating wider code and target coverage for MLIR.
 5. [HasQL](https://github.com/shraiysh/HaSSQL)
    : Built query handlers (back-end) for a local database system with a simple query language, using functional programming in Haskell.
 6. [GoTorrent](https://github.com/shraiysh/GoTorrent)
    : Built messages and handled concurrent downloads of file fragments for a BitTorrent client in Go. Features include concurrent download from peers, concurrent download of multiple torrents and handling of abrupt termination of download.
